# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible for receiving such patches depends on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of this Terraform configuration seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com).

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

- Type of issue (buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## Security Best Practices

This Terraform configuration implements several security best practices:

### S3 Bucket Security

- Public access blocked
- Server-side encryption enabled
- Versioning enabled for data protection
- Lifecycle policies for cost management
- CORS configuration for controlled access

### CloudFront Security

- Origin Access Control (OAC) for secure S3 access
- HTTPS enforcement
- Configurable price classes
- Optional custom domain support with ACM certificates

### IAM Security

- Principle of least privilege
- Prefix-based access control
- Separate roles for different services (EC2, ECS)
- No hardcoded credentials

### General Security

- Secure transport enforcement
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Regular security updates
- Documentation of security features

## Security Considerations

When using this configuration:

1. **Review IAM Permissions**: Ensure the IAM roles have only the necessary permissions
2. **Monitor Access**: Regularly review CloudTrail logs for unusual access patterns
3. **Update Regularly**: Keep Terraform and AWS provider versions up to date
4. **Custom Domains**: Use HTTPS and valid SSL certificates for custom domains
5. **CORS Configuration**: Only allow necessary origins in CORS settings
6. **Bucket Naming**: Use unique bucket names to prevent conflicts
7. **State Management**: Use secure remote state storage in production

## Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security bug report, we will:

1. Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions
2. Audit code to find any similar problems
3. Prepare fixes for all supported versions
4. Release new versions with the fixes
5. Announce the security vulnerability

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as patch versions (e.g., 1.0.1, 1.0.2) and will be clearly marked in the CHANGELOG.md file.
